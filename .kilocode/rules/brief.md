LiteNote is a UI web app for note taking. It connects with GitHub and, starting from README.md, create beautiful pages to display markdown files with links adding pages Ã  la Matuschak.

The url looks like `https://litenote.space/{user}/{repo}`. If the repo is public, LiteNote will directly get raw markdown files. If the repo is private, the user must authenticate first.
